The purpose of the *WholeProcess* script is to sequentially perfom all three steps of the method. 
This includes:
- The pre-processing [link](https://github.com/LittleCoinCoin/Plant_Counting/blob/Pre-Release/Documentation/Pre-Treatments/Process_image_for_FT.md)
- The Fourier analysis to approxiamte the geometry of the field [link](https://github.com/LittleCoinCoin/Plant_Counting/blob/Pre-Release/Documentation/Fourier/FrequencyAnalysis.md)
- The Multi-Agents System to refine the detection of the plants [link](https://github.com/LittleCoinCoin/Plant_Counting/blob/Pre-Release/Documentation/MAS/Multi_Images_Simulation_v12bis.md)

The parameters are individually explained in the documentation files corresponding to each scripts.
